## Rules

> Rules are ranked by most vital first


### Rule 1: Purchases must not grant competitive advantages, even small ones. 

Any form of "upgrades" or "power-ups" that can be purchased with real money results in a pay-to-win game, even if the same can also be obtained via other in-game methods.

Examples of games that fail this rule:
- Clash Royale
- Free Fire

### Rule 2: Progress must not grant competitive advantages.

> "Progress" is defined as the storage of an account's inventory, achievements, or in-game currency, where such items can be used to gain a competitive advantage.

**Note that "progress" is only defined across play sessions, or "games". As such, any "power-ups" or "weapons" obtainable in a game which do not carry over to the next, are permitted.**

In a nutshell, if player A has been playing the game for many years, but player B just joined, players A and B should be equally matched at the beginning of the game, apart from the skill acquired by player A. 

Examples of games that fail this rule:
- Minecraft: Survival

Examples of games that partially fail this rule:
- Fortnite: Battle Royale

### Rule 3: Progress must not grant cosmetics.

> "Cosmetics" are defined as any items not granting a competitive advantage that either appear in-game or can be used to obtain items that appear in-game. This includes in-game currency which can be used to get cosmetics.

As such, any game offering a "pass" system fails this rule. Purchasable "quest packs" that grant cosmetics on progression also violate this rule.

Examples of games that fail this rule:
- Fortnite: Battle Royale
- Minecraft: Creative
- Rocket League


### Rule 4: Each "game" should last not more than 30 minutes, or should have a fixed reasonable maximum playtime which can be known before ever playing the game

### Rule 5: The game must prioritise interaction with players you know in real life or have otherwise explicitly connected to in-game.  At least 50% of all players you interact with must fulfil this criteria

- ✅ Games in which your team of friends is competing with an equal number of players
- ✅ Games in which you compete against your friends
- ❌ Games in which your team of friends competes against a larger lobby
